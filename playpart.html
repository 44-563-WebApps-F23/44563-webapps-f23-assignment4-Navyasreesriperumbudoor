<h4>SOLNESS.</h4><p>[Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:]</p> Well, is
that you?
</p>
<p>
<h4>KAIA.</h4>I merely wished to let you know that I have come.
</p>
<p>
<h4>SOLNESS.</h4>Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?
</p>
<p>
<h4>KAIA.</h4>No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
coming presently to hear--
</p>
<p>
<h4>SOLNESS.</h4>How is the old man to-day?
</p>
<p>
<h4>KAIA.</h4>Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
to-day.
</p>
<p>
<h4>SOLNESS.</h4>Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.
</p>
<p><h4>SOLNESS.</h4><p>[Gloomily.]</p> I suppose I must be--or not far from it. <p>[Looks towards the
door to the right, which is opened at this moment.]</p> Ah! now it grows
light.</p>

<p>HILDA WANGEL comes in.  She has made some alteration in her
dress, and let down her skirt.</p>

<p><h4>HILDA.</h4>Good morning, Mr. Solness!</p>

<p><h4>SOLNESS.</h4><p>[Nods.]</p> Slept well?</p>

<p><h4>HILDA.</h4>Quite deliciously! Like a child in a cradle. Oh--I lay and stretched
myself like--like a princess!</p>

<p><h4>SOLNESS.</h4><p>[Smiles a little.]</p> You were thoroughly comfortable then?</p>

<p><h4>HILDA.</h4>I should think so.</p>

<p><h4>SOLNESS.</h4>And no doubt you dreamed, too.</p>
