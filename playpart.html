SOLNESS.
[Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:] Well, is
that you?
<br><br>
KAIA.
I merely wished to let you know that I have come.
<br><br>
SOLNESS.
Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?
<br><br>
KAIA.
No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
coming presently to hear--
<br><br>
SOLNESS.
How is the old man to-day?
<br><br>
KAIA.
Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
to-day.
<br><br>
SOLNESS.
Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.
