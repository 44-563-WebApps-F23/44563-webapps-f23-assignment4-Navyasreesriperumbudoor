<h4><p class="SOLNESS">SOLNESS.</p></h4><p class="direction">[Turns his head, and says in an off-hand tone of indifference:]</p><p class="speech">Well, is
that you?</p>


<h4><p class="KAIA">KAIA.</p></h4><p class="speech">I merely wished to let you know that I have come.
</p>

<h4><p class="SOLNESS">SOLNESS.</p></h4><p class="speech">Yes, yes, that's all right. Hasn't Ragnar come too?
</p>


<h4><p class="KAIA">KAIA.</p></h4><p class="speech">No, not yet. He had to wait a little while to see the doctor. But he is
coming presently to hear--
</p>

<h4><p class="SOLNESS">SOLNESS.</p></h4><p class="speech">How is the old man to-day?
</p>

<h4><p class="KAIA">KAIA.</p></h4><p class="speech">Not well. He begs you to excuse him; he is obliged to keep his bed
to-day.
</p>


<h4><p class="SOLNESS">SOLNESS.</p></h4><p class="speech">Why, of course; by all means let him rest. But now, get to your work.
</p>

<h4><p class="SOLNESS">SOLNESS.</p></h4><p class="direction">[Gloomily.]</p><p class="speech">I suppose I must be--or not far from it.</p><p class="direction">[Looks towards the
door to the right, which is opened at this moment.]</p><p class="speech">Ah! now it grows
light.</p>

<p class="direction">HILDA WANGEL comes in.  She has made some alteration in her
dress, and let down her skirt.</p>

<h4><p class="HILDA">HILDA.</p></h4><p class="speech">Good morning, Mr. Solness!</p>

<h4><p class="SOLNESS">SOLNESS.</p></h4><p class="direction">[Nods.]</p> <p class="speech">Slept well?</p>

<h4><p class="HILDA">HILDA.</p></h4><p class="speech">Quite deliciously! Like a child in a cradle. Oh--I lay and stretched
myself like--like a princess!</p>

<h4><p class="SOLNESS">SOLNESS.</p></h4><p class="direction">[Smiles a little.]</p><p class="speech"> You were thoroughly comfortable then?</p>

<h4><p class="HILDA">HILDA.</p></h4><p class="speech">I should think so.</p>

<h4><p class="SOLNESS">SOLNESS.</p></h4><p class="speech">And no doubt you dreamed, too.</p>
